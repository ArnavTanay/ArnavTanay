I’m a Computer Science student currently focusing on building strong fundamentals in programming and problem solving. I mainly work with Java and Python, and I’m gradually moving from learning concepts to applying them through small, practical projects.

Right now, I’m spending time on:
- Data Structures and Algorithms using Java
- Core programming concepts and clean code practices
- Machine Learning basics with Python
- Using Git and GitHub properly to document and track my work

This GitHub is a work in progress. You’ll find:
- Beginner to intermediate Java projects
- Python scripts and experiments
- Academic and self-learning projects, improved over time
- Well-documented repositories as I grow

I prefer building things step by step rather than rushing into complex projects. The goal is to understand how things work under the hood and write code that actually makes sense.

More projects coming as I learn and build consistently.
